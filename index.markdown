Brief Bio
---------

I have 25 years of engineering, product, and design IC and leadership experience spanning the full growth spectrum—from lean startups and Fortune 500 enterprises to unicorn-scale ventures. 

I co-founded and served as SVP Product at [eDealya](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/edealya), raising approximately $1M from [Nielsen's incubator](https://www.nielsen.com) and successfully leading the company through an entrepreneurial journey that brought me from Tel Aviv to Silicon Valley. I’ve held key product leadership roles at [Totango](https://www.totango.com), [Degreed](https://www.degreed.com), and [Grovo](https://www.grovo.com).

My foundational experience includes engineering at [Intel](https://www.intel.com) and leading engineering and product teams at [Amdocs (NASDAQ: DOX)](https://www.amdocs.com), delivering projects for major clients such as [AT&T](https://www.att.com). 

I was the Head of Product Design at [Gainsight](https://www.gainsight.com), a private-equity-held unicorn, leading a global team of 25+ designers and researchers, significantly enhancing user experience and representing the company at events attended by 5,000+ participants (see my [Pulse conference talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYp0qn1kThg)).

At [Totango](https://www.totango.com), I also built a mobile app end-to-end in Swift—from scoping and design to writing the code—that won a CODiE Award.

My leadership skills were first honed as an officer in an elite Israeli military unit, completing rigorous training equivalent to West Point officer training with distinction. 

I hold a B.Sc. in Information Technology Engineering (Magna Cum Laude) and an MBA, and completed a specialized entrepreneurial program at the [Merage School of Business, UC Irvine](https://merage.uci.edu). 

I also hold a [registered patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US11785482B1/) on robotic automation for indoor location testing.

 As a side project, I developed a smart contract on Solana for an insurance use case.
