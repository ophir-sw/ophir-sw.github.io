### Hey, Skillable team,

I’m happy this role opened up—I feel it’s a strong match for my background, and I’d love to work again with the many Skillable folks I already know and respect.

#### Why me

- **~ 10 years in EdTech.** Shipped SCOR and xAPI bridges, pushed micro-learning catalogs into enterprise LMSs, and ran API programs.
  
- **System-level thinking.** I design integrations that clear Fortune 500 security reviews while remaining easy for developers to adopt. **
  
- **Strong relationships at Skillable.** I already collaborate well with several team members—from executives to individual contributors—and they can vouch for my value and character. **
  
- **Quick path to value.** I turn customer problems into solutions you can ship in short timeframes and monetize.

Looking forward to exploring this opportunity.

Thanks for your consideration,  
Ophir
