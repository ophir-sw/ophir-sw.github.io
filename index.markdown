Brief Bio
---------

I bring 25 years of experience across engineering, product, and design—spanning early-stage startups, unicorns, and Fortune 500s—with a sharp focus in the last decade on **AI-driven innovation**, **machine learning pipelines**, and **LLM-powered automation**.

I co-founded and served as SVP Product at [eDealya](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/edealya), raising ~$1M from [Nielsen’s incubator](https://www.nielsen.com) and leading the company through a full founder journey from Tel Aviv to Silicon Valley.

At [ZaiNar](https://www.zainar.com), I designed a **machine learning pipeline** to calculate real-time **3D indoor location** using RF signal data and probabilistic models.

At [Gainsight](https://www.gainsight.com), I served as Head of Product Design, leading a global team of 25+ and implementing an **LLM-based DesignOps system** that radically improved product velocity, UX consistency, and team workflows. This involved integrating AI tooling to automate UX audits, enforce design standards, and generate artifacts—transforming how we operated at scale.

Earlier, I held key product leadership roles at [Totango](https://www.totango.com), [Degreed](https://www.degreed.com), and [Grovo](https://www.grovo.com). My engineering roots were forged at [Intel](https://www.intel.com), and I led cross-functional delivery at [Amdocs (NASDAQ: DOX)](https://www.amdocs.com) for [AT&T](https://www.att.com).

I hold a [registered patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US11785482B1/) in robotic automation for indoor location testing and built a smart contract on [Solana](https://solana.com) for a decentralized insurance use case.

Academically, I hold a B.Sc. in Information Technology Engineering (Magna Cum Laude), an MBA, and completed an entrepreneurial program at [UC Irvine’s Merage School of Business](https://merage.uci.edu).

My leadership foundation was built in an elite Israeli military unit, where I graduated with distinction from a program equivalent to West Point.
