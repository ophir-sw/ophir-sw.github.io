Brief Bio
---------

I’m an engineer‑turned‑product leader with 25 years of experience building API‑first platforms, with nearly a decade devoted to learning technologies. I bring deep, hands-on experience across the full stack, especially with backend APIs and learning platforms.

At **[Grovo](https://www.grovo.com)** I built the **SCORM** based micro‑learning catalog extension to enterprise LMSs—work that later helped spark [Cornerstone OnDemand](https://www.cornerstoneondemand.com)’s acquisition. I scaled backend APIs and admin tooling for global learning ecosystems at [Degreed](https://www.degreed.com), and shipped mobile SDKs plus backend integrations that surface customer‑health insights at [Totango](https://www.totango.com). 

My engineering roots were forged at [Intel](https://www.intel.com), and I led cross-functional project delivery at [Amdocs (NASDAQ: DOX)](https://www.amdocs.com) wokring with big clients such as [AT&T](https://www.att.com).

Most recently, as Head of Product Design at **[Gainsight](https://www.gainsight.com)**, I merged engineering discipline with UX Ops, automating design audits with LLMs and tightening the spec‑to‑code feedback loop.

I hold a [registered patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US11785482B1/) in using robotic automation for indoor location testing.

Academically, I hold a B.Sc. in Information Technology Engineering (Magna Cum Laude), an MBA, and completed an entrepreneurial program at [UC Irvine’s Merage School of Business](https://merage.uci.edu).

My leadership skills were shaped as an officer in an elite Israeli military unit, where I graduated with distinction from a officer course equivalent to West Point.
