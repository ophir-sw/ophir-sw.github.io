### Hi Workstream crew,

I’m a product–design–engineering polyglot who lives for the moment when “hmm, could we…?” becomes “yep, it’s live—check the metrics.”  
From low‑level code at Intel to co‑founding, fundraising, exit, and most recently leading Product Design at Gainsight while hacking AI workflows that cut SDR cycle time by days—I’ve worn the full stack.

## Why this Founder‑in‑Residence role has my name on it

- **Swiss‑army‑knife builder:** Concept → scope → user validation → pixel‑perfect UI → prod release—I’ve owned every link in that chain and patch gaps on the fly.  
- **AI‑first GTM chops:** Spun up agentic outbound, auto‑QA call summaries, and churn‑risk predictors with LLMs + low/no‑code in weeks, not quarters. Revenue teams stopped dreading Mondays.  
- **Front‑line empathy:** Grew up in family restaurants and still interview shift leads for fun; I feel the hourly‑worker pain your customers face.  
- **Founder mentality:** Raised seed, chased first dollars, negotiated acquisition—comfortable in fog‑of‑war and biased to what moves the needle today.

## How I’d attack your mandate

1. **Map every human hand‑off** in the lead‑to‑renewal journey; rank drudge work by ARR upside.  
2. **Prototype agentic flows fast** (LangGraph / Retool / Python); drop them into one pod and measure ruthlessly.  
3. **Publish wins**—snack‑able playbooks, Loom demos—so Sales/CS/RevOps start demanding more automation.  
4. **Iterate or kill.** If a build doesn’t move pipeline in two sprints, it dies; backlog stays lean.

What’s in it for you? A revenue engine that scales without headcount bloat—and a teammate who treats ambiguity like oxygen.

**P.S. _Don’t miss the chance to chat._ Give me 15 minutes and I’ll walk you through the wild prototypes I’ve cranked out in the last two months. Worst case, you steal a few ideas and we both leave smarter.**

Cheers,  
Ophir
